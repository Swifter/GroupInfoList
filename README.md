A Universal Windows Platform demo project for the SemanticZoom control.

This project demonstrates the use of a SemanticZoom control on the Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10.
A tutorial webpage will shortly be created to illustrate the concepts demonstrated in this sample.

The code is well documented internally, with comments on almost every relevant line.  Meanwhile, you can
learn about the SemanticZoom control at this Microsoft URL:
