A Universal Windows Platform demo project for the SemanticZoom control.

This project demonstrates the use of a SemanticZoom control on the Universal Windows Platform for Windows 10.
A tutorial webpage illustrating the concepts demonstrated in this sample can be found [here](https://swifter.github.io/GroupInfoList/semanticzoom_web.htm)

The code is well documented internally, with comments on almost every relevant line.  Meanwhile, you can
